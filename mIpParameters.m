% continuous-time linearized model [ALCmIP, BLCmIp, CLCmp, DLCmIp]
% discrete-time linearized model [ALDmIP, BLDmIp, CLDmp, DLDmIp]

% Load Neeraj's state estimate feedback controller parameters
% This defines his K and L matrices
load('MiP_control.mat')

% Construct the digital controller matrices
% These appear in the controller present in the Simulink feedback path
